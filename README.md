# Campus Map
This is a full-stack project I built when I was taking Software Design and Implementation class. <br/>
This application is hosted on DigitalOcean under my domin name: <a href="http://www.jinghua.website/map" target="_blank">www.jinghua.website/map</a>

## Features:
- **Shortest Path**: <br>
  When user selects two buildings, server-side will run A* search on the graph model and return the shortest path back to client-side.
- **Auto-complete**:<br>
    When user click on an input box, a list of suggested locations will be displayed(currently
    the full list of buildings, but can be optimized using a recommendation algorithm).
    When user starts typing, client side will send the input string to the
    server and server will send back a list of matched buildings.
- **Turn-by-turn Navigation**:<br>
    When a path is returned from the server, client side will display a turn-by-turn navigation
    which indicates the how to get from one vertex to the next vertex on the campus map.
- **Zoomable**ï¼š<br>
    User can zoom in and zoom out to the center of the current viewport by using the zoom
    buttons or scrolling.
- **Zoom to Path**: <br>
    When start and end are selected, map will display the path and zoom in to the path and a
    turn-by-turn navigation will be displayed on the sidebar.
- **Draggable**: <br>
    User can drag the map to relocate the center of the map.
- **Find Nearest Building**: <br>
    When user double click a point on the map, the application can find the nearest building
    on the map using KD-Tree.

## Client-side
- Front-end is built with React and Ant Design UI library for development efficiency
- I implemented the drag-and-drop feature with Canvas and x/y offset since I couldn't find an elegant library that can handle the job.

# Server-side
- With Java Spark, I implemented the MVC design pattern for better modularity and less coupling
- The main technical difficulty is to build all the low-level models and data structures, such as priority queue, balanced tree, and genetic graph, from scratch. A lot of 
 software engineering strategies were used to ensure correctness,
including test-driven programming, unit test, integration test, representation invariance, abstract function, proof, as well as detailed documentation.  

# Hosting
- Host on DigitalOcean with Nginx as reverse proxy
